# Resume-to-Job-Matching-Search-Engine
Welcome to the Resume-to-Job Matching Search Engine Repository!

This repository contains the codebase outlining the development of an innovative resume-to-job matching search engine. Our goal is to align job seekers with appropriate job opportunities using cutting-edge data science and machine learning technologies.

The project involves scraping job postings from platforms such as Indeed and LinkedIn, generating job description embeddings using OpenAI, and storing data in MongoDB. What sets this search engine apart is its unique ability to tokenize and summarize a user's resume using GPT-4, followed by creating an embedding for matching with job postings. The matching process is conducted through a K-nearest neighbor algorithm, ensuring high accuracy and relevance in job recommendations.

Other crucial components of this system include automated job postings updates using Airflow and an interactive user interface built with Streamlit. 

Overall, this project represents a significant advancement in harnessing technology for effective job matchmaking, offering a streamlined, personalized job search experience. Feel free to explore the codebase, provide feedback, and contribute to further enhancements. Your involvement is key to making this project even more impactful. Happy coding!
